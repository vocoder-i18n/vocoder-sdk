# CLAUDE.md - Vocoder SDK

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Vocoder SDK monorepo.

**Keep this file current.** When making changes that affect bundling policy, package structure, versioning strategy, local dev workflow, or any other section here — update the relevant section before marking the task complete. Stale guidance is worse than no guidance.

## Project Structure

pnpm workspace monorepo:

```
sdk/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/       # @vocoder/core — shared primitives: hash, ICU formatting, cookies, types
│   ├── config/     # @vocoder/config — defineConfig + re-exports from core
│   ├── extractor/  # @vocoder/extractor — Babel AST string extractor (bundled into plugin + cli)
│   ├── plugin/     # @vocoder/plugin — build plugin (Vite, Next.js, Webpack, Rollup, esbuild)
│   ├── react/      # @vocoder/react — components, hooks, provider, locale selector
│   ├── cli/        # @vocoder/cli — project setup, string extraction, translation sync
│   └── mcp/        # @vocoder/mcp — MCP server
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Package Versioning (Two-Tier via Changesets)

Packages version in two independent groups:

| Group | Packages | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Tooling** (locked together) | `cli`, `config`, `extractor`, `mcp`, `plugin` | These share API contracts with the backend. If `cli` and `plugin` bundle different extractors they produce different fingerprints → translations unreachable (404). |
| **Runtime** (independent) | `core`, `react` | Breaking API changes deserve semver majors without forcing a tooling re-release. |

**Release workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Describe what changed (bump level applies to affected group)
pnpm changeset

# 2. Apply versions
pnpm changeset version

# 3. Build + publish
pnpm release
```

**Rules:**
- Always document new / modified code. But only ever document the way things currently work. Do not make reference to the way things used to work, or document in a way that describes why something changed. We just need documentation and unit tests to be an accurate reflection of how the code should currently work.
- Never manually edit `version` in individual `package.json` files — let `changeset version` do it
- Never publish a single package in isolation — always publish all via `pnpm release`
- `@vocoder/extractor`, `@vocoder/config`, and `@vocoder/core` are bundled into plugin and CLI (`noExternal` in tsup). Keep them in `devDependencies` in those packages, not `dependencies`

## Bundling Policy

| Package | Bundles extractor? | Bundles config? | Bundles core? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@vocoder/plugin` | yes (`noExternal`) | yes | yes |
| `@vocoder/cli` | yes (`noExternal`) | yes | yes |
| `@vocoder/extractor` | no (is the extractor) | no | no (runtime dep) |
| `@vocoder/react` | no | no | no (runtime dep) |
| `@vocoder/core` | no | no | n/a (is core) |

Plugin and CLI are fully self-contained — consumers install nothing extra. Do not move extractor, config, or core back to runtime `dependencies` in plugin or cli.

`@vocoder/react` and `@vocoder/extractor` declare `@vocoder/core` as a real runtime dependency (users install it). Plugin and CLI bundle core via `noExternal` so they remain self-contained.

`VocoderTranslationData` is the canonical type in `@vocoder/core/src/types.ts`. Both `@vocoder/config` and `@vocoder/plugin` re-export it from core — there is no longer a duplicate local copy to keep in sync.

## Local Dev (yalc)

The `dev-sdk.cjs` / `dev-sdk.js` scripts in consumer projects rebuild ALL packages whenever any dist changes, then push all yalc-managed packages. This ensures bundled extractor stays in sync across plugin and cli.

**Do not** split packages into independent watch-and-push — they must all rebuild together.

Run translate via `pnpm exec vocoder translate` or `pnpm run translate`, never `npx @vocoder/cli translate` (pulls published npm, not local build).

## README Synchronization

When modifying any user-facing API, update the corresponding README.

| README | Update when... |
|---|---|
| **README.md** (root) | Adding/removing packages, changing overall quick start, cross-package behavior |
| **packages/core/README.md** | Adding/changing exports from `@vocoder/core` |
| **packages/react/README.md** | Adding/changing components, props, hooks, provider behavior |
| **packages/plugin/README.md** | Changing bundler setup, fingerprint computation, env vars, build-time constants |
| **packages/cli/README.md** | Adding/changing CLI commands, flags, sync modes, extraction behavior |

Style:
- Document what exists today. No planned features, migration history, or how things used to work.
- Lead with usage examples. Code first, explain after.
- Use tables for props/options/flags.
- No emojis in READMEs.
- Never mention competitors in documentation or code.
- Each package README is self-contained.

## Open Source Document Synchronization

When making changes that affect open-source usage, contribution flow, release hygiene, security reporting, repository metadata, or what gets published to npm, update the relevant OSS docs in the same task before marking it complete.

Keep these files in sync when applicable:

| File | Update when... |
|---|---|
| **README.md** (root) | Package lineup, quick start, release workflow, or cross-package behavior changes |
| **CONTRIBUTING.md** | Local setup, test/build expectations, release steps, or contribution policy changes |
| **SECURITY.md** | Vulnerability reporting process, security contact, or scope changes |
| **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** | Community standards or enforcement contact changes |
| **SUPPORT.md** | Support channels or issue-routing guidance changes |
| **OPEN_SOURCE_CHECKLIST.md** | New release gates, repo-health requirements, or launch-readiness expectations |
| **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** and **.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** | Information required from contributors or reviewers changes |
| **package.json** metadata and package **LICENSE** files | Repository URLs, bugs/homepage links, license, publish surface, or package visibility changes |

Rules:
- If a code or config change would make one of these docs inaccurate, update the doc in the same PR/task.
- Do not leave TODO-style placeholders for OSS process docs when the correct current behavior is knowable from the repo.
- Treat stale OSS docs as a correctness bug, not a follow-up nice-to-have.

## Acceptance Gate

`./scripts/verify.sh` is the sole authority on whether a ticket's work is done (constitution §12, §2.1). It resolves the ticket from the branch name (`NNN-slug` → ticket `NNN`; anything else is exempt), loads that ticket's acceptance record, checks constitution drift, runs build → typecheck → lint → every package's own unit suite plus the gate's own suite, scans the change's added lines for a pricing disclosure, resolves every criterion against the tests that actually exist and actually passed, and refuses to pass when any criterion is unproven or a disclosure is found. Full contract: `specs/022-verify-acceptance-manifest/contracts/verify-cli.md`.

```
./scripts/verify.sh              # verify the current branch
./scripts/verify.sh --evidence   # emit only the evidence block, no slow checks
```

**Record location and shape.** One JSON file per ticket, committed at `.vocoder/acceptance/<NNN>.json`:

```json
{
	"ticket": "VOC-22",
	"criteria": [
		{
			"id": "AC1",
			"statement": "What is claimed, in one sentence",
			"test": "scripts/__tests__/disclosure.test.ts::disclosure > names the file, line, and matched term in the failure"
		},
		{
			"id": "AC4",
			"statement": "What is claimed, when no automated test can prove it",
			"evidence": { "type": "manual", "ref": "PR #NN — description of what a reviewer checks" }
		}
	]
}
```

- `test` is `<repo-relative file>::<full nested test name>`, joined with `::`.
- Every criterion declares **exactly one** of `test` or `evidence`. Both, or neither, is a malformed record and exits the gate with code `2`.
- The record is read-only to the gate and immutable once the work merges.
- See `.vocoder/acceptance/022.json` for a worked example.

**This repo is public and MIT-licensed.** A number committed here is disclosed permanently the moment it's pushed, whether or not the PR merges. The gate's disclosure scan exists only because of this — `app` (private) has no equivalent check.

- The scan looks only at **added lines** in the diff against the merge base — never full file content, never history already on `main`.
- A match requires a shape (a currency symbol, a percentage, a per-unit/per-period number) **and** a nearby pricing-domain word (`credit`, `plan`, `subscription`, `cost`, `price`, `rate`, `margin`, `quota`) on the same line. Neither alone is enough — this is what keeps a bare formatting example (a currency value with no pricing language near it, such as the ones in `packages/core/README.md`, `packages/react/README.md`, and `packages/mcp/docs/icu-patterns.md` demonstrating `<T>`'s number formatting) from ever being flagged.
- Plan identifiers (`free`, `starter`, `pro`, `enterprise`) never trigger a match on their own — naming a tier is not disclosing what it costs. They also never exempt a real figure sitting next to them.
- The scan excludes `scripts/__tests__/` — the gate's own test fixtures necessarily contain synthetic examples shaped like the values this check catches (never real Vocoder figures — constitution §13.7), and excluding that directory from the live scan is what lets this feature's own PR pass without the check needing to exempt itself in its matching logic.
- Implementation: `scripts/verify/disclosure.ts`. Matching logic (`matchLine`) is pure and directly unit-tested against string fixtures in `scripts/__tests__/disclosure.test.ts` — no git or filesystem access needed to verify it.

**Typecheck** runs via the root `typecheck` script (`pnpm -r --if-present run typecheck`), which every package must be able to run standing alone — give a new package its own `tsconfig.json` scoped to its own `src`, the way every existing package does. A package without one falls back to the workspace root's `tsconfig.json`, which type-checks across every package's source simultaneously through the `@vocoder/*` path aliases — this is slow, and can produce compiler crashes that have nothing to do with the package actually being worked on.

## CLI TUI Output Standards

All CLI command output must follow these conventions. Apply them without prompting when working in `packages/cli/`.

### Log Levels

| Function | Renders | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `p.log.success(msg)` | ✓ green | Primary completed step or result line. Prefer simple output such as `Label: value` or a short completed sentence. |
| `p.log.warn(msg)` | ▲ yellow | Non-fatal condition — operation continues. What happened and why it matters. |
| `p.log.error(msg)` | ✗ red | Fatal condition — `return 1` follows within a few lines. Never used for warnings. |
| `p.log.message(msg)` | (none) | Undecorated supporting text only: section headers, numbered/bulleted lists, recovery steps after an error, one-line guidance, blank spacing. |

**Rule:** never use `p.note()`.

**Rule:** never use `p.log.info()` in `packages/cli`. There is no blue-dot state in the CLI. Supplementary text is plain `p.log.message()`.

**Rule:** when working in `packages/cli`, use the shared `CommandSession` helper instead of calling `@clack/prompts` primitives ad hoc from top-level commands.

**Rule:** when exiting with code 1, the primary signal is always `p.log.error()` or `spinner.stop(msg, 1)` — never `p.log.warn()` alone. Use `p.log.warn()` only when the function continues after the warning.

### Inline Styling

| Construct | Use for |
|---|---|
| `highlight(value)` | Identifiers and discrete values that a user will scan for: project names, app dirs, locale codes, branch names, file paths, string counts, env var names, commands, API keys, emails, URLs. **Not** for prose text, error sentences, or API-returned descriptions. |
| `chalk.bold(text)` | Standalone label text only: `p.intro()` title, `p.log.message()` section headers |
| `chalk.red(text)` | `p.outro()` only, for fatal-exit messages that must stand out |
| `dim(text)` | Structural chrome only: separators, `printCommand()` decorations |
| `chalk.green("✓")` / `chalk.red("✗")` | Inline per-item status within formatted result strings |

**Rule:** never call `chalk.bold()` inside `p.log.success/warn/error/info()` — use `highlight()` instead.

**Rule:** prefer `Label: value` rows for summaries and steady-state output. These render as green primary rows through `CommandSession.step()`. Keep labels plain text and highlight only the dynamic values that users need to scan.

### Spinners

- `spinner.start("Verb-ing noun…")` — present participle, trailing `…` (Unicode ellipsis, not `...`)
- `spinner.stop("Result line")` — no trailing ellipsis; usually a short completed sentence or `Label: value`
- `spinner.stop("Terse error", 1)` — exit code `1` for all spinner failures; message is a short noun phrase
- Never call `p.log.*` while a spinner is running — stop the spinner first

### Command Entry / Exit

- Every top-level command must start through `CommandSession("Command Title")`
- Every exit path must call `p.outro()` immediately before returning — no silent returns
- `p.outro("Done.")` — clean exit default
- `p.outro(chalk.red("Fatal: reason"))` — fatal build-blocking exit that must stand out
- `p.cancel("message")` — user-initiated cancellation only

### Error + Guidance Pattern

```ts
// Fatal — no spinner running
p.log.error("What failed.");
p.log.message("Run `vocoder command` to recover.");
p.outro("Failed.");
return 1;

// Fatal — spinner was running
spinner.stop("Terse failure noun", 1);
for (const line of getGuidanceLines()) p.log.message(line);
p.outro("Failed.");
return 1;

// Limit error (structured guidance)
spinner.stop(limitError.message, 1);
for (const line of getLimitErrorGuidance(limitError)) p.log.message(line);
p.outro("Failed.");
return 1;
```

Guidance / recovery lines always use plain `p.log.message()`. Never `p.log.warn()` after a fatal signal.

### Information Density

One concept, one line. Never state the same fact in multiple places.

**No-repeat rule:** spinner stop, subsequent log calls, and outro are all visible to the user in sequence. If the spinner stop says X, the next log line must not restate X. If `p.log.error` names a recovery command, `p.outro` must not repeat it.

**Combine related quantities on one line:**
```ts
// ✗ — two info lines for one comparison
p.log.message(`Used this month: ${current.toLocaleString()} chars`);
p.log.message(`Required for this sync: ${required.toLocaleString()} chars`);

// ✓ — one line, same information
p.log.message(`Used: ${current.toLocaleString()} / Needed: ${required.toLocaleString()} chars`);
```

**Guidance cap:** maximum 2 plain guidance lines after any single error.

**Outro scope:** `p.outro()` is forward-looking ("what to do next") or empty. Never use it to repeat an error reason or recovery command already shown by a log line.

**Guidance vs. summary:** info lines after an error tell the user WHAT TO DO — not a re-description of what went wrong (that's the error/spinner line's job).

### Monorepo Labels

- Single-app root: omit dir label from messages
- Named app dir: include `highlight(appDir)` in spinner start/stop and per-result lines
- Root app within a monorepo: display as `(root)`, not empty string

### Surface Consistency

- `bin.ts`, `packages/cli/README.md`, and command implementations must describe the same commands and flags
- Remove dead flags instead of documenting future behavior
- Keep examples aligned with the actual current output style

---

## TypeScript

Strict mode throughout. Build must succeed with zero errors before any task is complete.

```bash
pnpm build       # must succeed
pnpm test        # must pass
```

- Never use `any` — use `unknown` or proper types
- Files: `kebab-case.ts(x)`
- Components: `PascalCase`
- Functions: `camelCase`

## Essential Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # install dependencies
pnpm build            # build all packages
pnpm dev              # watch mode
pnpm test             # run all tests
pnpm lint             # biome lint
pnpm check:write      # biome lint + format (auto-fix)
```
