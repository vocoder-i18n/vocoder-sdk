## 0.23.0

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 1187b2a: `vocoder_regenerate_key` picked the wrong app in a monorepo, and told agents to
  write a config field that does not exist.

  It selected `existingApps[0]` — whichever app the lookup happened to return
  first — so an agent working in `apps/admin` could rotate `apps/web`'s API key
  instead. It now uses the CLI's `resolveLookupMatch`, which prefers an exact
  `appDir` match and only falls back to a whole-repo app when one exists. When
  nothing matches it says which directory was missing rather than proceeding with
  an arbitrary app.

  The config it emitted included `appId`, which is not a field on `VocoderConfig`
  at all: TypeScript rejects it and the config parser silently drops it. It also
  pinned `localesDir: 'src/locales'`, diverging from both the CLI and the SDK
  default. Config text is now rendered by the CLI.

  `@vocoder/cli/lib` gains `renderVocoderConfig`, `writeVocoderConfig`,
  `resolveLookupMatch` and `ResolvedLookupMatch`. `writeVocoderConfig` keeps its
  behaviour and now delegates its content to `renderVocoderConfig`, mirroring the
  `renderWorkflowYaml` / `writeGitHubActionsWorkflow` split.

- 583f8f6: `vocoder_translate` now extracts through the CLI instead of its own copy, so
  monorepos work.

  The MCP server ignored `apps[]` entirely and hardcoded `appDir: ""` into both
  the fingerprint scope and the submission. Every monorepo therefore uploaded one
  merged string set under a scope the plugin never computes at build time — a
  fingerprint matching nothing, so the runtime asked for a bundle that was never
  built.

  Per-app extraction moves to `utils/extract-apps.ts` and is exported from
  `@vocoder/cli/lib` as `extractApps` and `resolveAppDirs`. The CLI command keeps
  its spinner through two optional callbacks; nothing else about its behaviour
  changes. Both callers now resolve app directories, merge per-app config over
  root config, and compute the `${projectShortId}:${appDir}` fingerprint scope
  through one implementation.

  `vocoder_translate` also gains an `appDir` input, mirroring the CLI's
  `--app-dir`, so an agent can target a single app in a monorepo.

- 7b205ee: The MCP server now renders its GitHub Actions workflow with the CLI's own
  generator instead of hand-building a copy.

  `@vocoder/cli/lib` gains `WORKFLOW_RELATIVE_PATH`, `renderWorkflowYaml`,
  `writeGitHubActionsWorkflow`, `readWorkflowBranches` and `readWorkflowCommitMode`.

  The MCP's duplicate had drifted in four ways at once. It omitted the
  `github.actor != 'vocoder-bot[bot]'` guard, so a bot commit could retrigger the
  workflow. It omitted the `permissions` block, so the push failed on a
  default-read-only token. It omitted `commit-mode`, which is what the CLI reads
  back to decide between opening a PR and pushing directly. And it told agents to
  write `.github/workflows/vocoder.yml` while the CLI writes and reads
  `vocoder-translate.yml` — so in an MCP-provisioned repo `readWorkflowBranches`
  and `readWorkflowCommitMode` both returned null and branch and commit-mode
  configuration was silently ignored.

  The workflow path was previously written out in seven places across the two
  packages, three times inside the CLI alone, and they disagreed. It is now one
  exported constant.

## 0.21.0

### Patch Changes

- 0b67cbd: Fix the CLI build emitting no JavaScript, and correct the `./lib` types path.

  The ESM build failed to resolve `@babel/preset-typescript/package.json`, a
  static require inside `@babel/core`'s config-file detector. The code path is
  unreachable at runtime — `transformMsgProps` runs with `configFile: false`
  and no presets — but esbuild resolves every require at bundle time. The same
  stub already used in `@vocoder/plugin` is now applied here. Previously only
  `.d.mts` files were emitted, which also broke `@vocoder/mcp`'s import of
  `@vocoder/cli/lib`.

  `exports["./lib"].types` pointed at `./dist/lib.d.ts`, but tsup emits
  `lib.d.mts`, so TypeScript consumers of `@vocoder/cli/lib` resolved no types.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- Rename CLI commands and MCP tools for consistency; eliminate VocoderClient duplication.

  **CLI command renames:**
  - `translations` → `pull` (git-pull analogy)
  - `app-config` → `config` (shows project config, not runtime status)
  - `create-app` → `create-project` (project-centric management)

  **MCP tool renames:**
  - `vocoder_sync` → `vocoder_translate`
  - `vocoder_get_translations` → `vocoder_pull`
  - `vocoder_status` → `vocoder_config`
  - `vocoder_project_create` → `vocoder_create_project`

  **Architecture:** `VocoderClient` removed from `@vocoder/mcp`; `createClient()` now returns `VocoderAPI` from `@vocoder/cli/lib`. Shared logic (`buildStringEntries`, `computeSourceEntriesHash`, `extractProjectShortIdFromApiKey`) exported from `@vocoder/cli/lib` as single source of truth.

  **`@vocoder/core`:** adds `extractProjectShortIdFromApiKey` utility.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 438ef8c: Simplify `vocoder init`: write only two files (GitHub Actions workflow + API key to `.env.local`), remove `vocoder.config.ts` generation, rename workflow to `vocoder-translate.yml`, add `on-failure: proceed` input. Remove scaffold, write-config, and mcp-setup modules. MCP setup moved to next-steps output. TUI improvements: consistent spacing across all custom prompts, pre-selected value floated to top in locale selector, brand hex colors replaced with semantic chalk colors.

## 0.18.1

### Patch Changes

- Update repository URL: vocoder-sdk → sdk (github.com/vocoder-i18n/sdk).

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- bbb9642: Add verbose mode, .env.local support, and smarter GitHub installation auto-select.
  - `vocoder init --verbose`: logs each API request URL and response status; previews response body on errors. Useful for debugging custom `--api-url` setups
  - All commands now load both `.env` and `.env.local` from CWD and the git root (monorepo support). Shell env always wins. Fixes setups where `VOCODER_API_URL` was in `.env.local` and silently ignored
  - API keys are now written to `.env.local` (prefers existing `.env.local`, falls back to `.env`, creates `.env.local` if neither exists)
  - GitHub installation prompt is skipped when the repo owner matches exactly one installation — the right account is selected automatically. Shows a warning when no installation covers the current repo's owner

- 237c29c: Add `vocoder regenerate-key` CLI command and `vocoder_regenerate_key` MCP tool.
  - `vocoder regenerate-key`: dedicated command to rotate the project API key; requires admin or owner role (403 → friendly message); rewrites all `vocoder.config.ts` files with current appIds
  - `vocoder init`: simplified — when repo is already set up, logs app name and points to `regenerate-key`; no longer offers key rotation inline
  - `vocoder app`: added `--alias project` for backward compatibility; fixed help copy ("starter app" not "starter project")
  - MCP: `vocoder_regenerate_key` tool using stored browser auth; throws with guidance if no stored token
  - MCP: `vocoder://docs/app-config` resource — org→project→app structure, API key placement, appId in `vocoder.config.ts`, key rotation, common setup issues
  - MCP: `vocoder_app_create` tool description and inline instructions now include `apps` array with `appId` per directory
  - MCP: `vocoder_init_status`, `vocoder_init_start`, `vocoder_init_complete`, `vocoder_app_create` tools registered
  - User-facing copy: "project" → "app" throughout CLI prompts, labels, and MCP tool descriptions

## 0.17.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix remaining "project" terminology in user-facing strings. Rename CLI `vocoder project` command to `vocoder app` (with `project` kept as alias for backward compatibility). Update log messages, TUI labels, error messages, and MCP tool descriptions to use "app" consistently.

## 0.17.1

## 0.17.0

## 0.16.6

## 0.16.5

### Patch Changes

- Migrate user-facing "project" terminology to "app" across CLI and MCP. Renames `ProjectConfig` type to `AppConfig`. Updates all help text, error messages, MCP tool descriptions, and JSDoc comments.

## 0.16.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix MCP claude mcp add command: move server name before flags to avoid env var parse error; remove raw API key display from init output

## 0.16.3

### Patch Changes

- MCP setup: add helper text explaining what the MCP server enables; improve auto-registration failure message

## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix claude mcp add command: use -e flag instead of --env for environment variables

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- Refactor init command into focused modules; fix plan limit errors showing upgrade URL; use app externalId in generated config files

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- Provider API improvements and SDK audit fixes
  - `VocoderProvider`: replace `cookies` prop with `initialLocale` and `preview` boolean props — server resolves cookie values and passes them down; provider normalizes initialLocale against available locales automatically
  - Remove `VocoderProviderServer` (RSC cannot provide context; was a no-op)
  - Move `DEFAULT_ORDINAL_ICU`, `buildPluralICU`, `buildSelectICU`, `PLURAL_CLDR`, `ALL_CLDR` to `@vocoder/core` — single source of truth for T.tsx and extractor
  - Add `applyOrdinalForms()` to `@vocoder/core` — shared ordinal suffix/word logic replaces triplicated implementations
  - Fix `context.t()` missing formality support — now uses full `TOptions` consistent with global `t()` and `<T>`
  - Fix `hasTranslation()` to be hash-only — remove hidden dual-mode (hash-or-source-text)
  - Fix preview query param: `syncPreviewQueryParam()` now reads `?vocoder=true|false` as intended
  - `Industry` type replaces `AppIndustry` (deprecated alias kept); adds travel, legal, government, nonprofit, other

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: @vocoder/core shared primitives, full test coverage, extractor restructure
  - New `@vocoder/core` package: hash, ICU formatting, cookie utilities, shared types
  - Moved hash, ICU, and cookie utilities from `@vocoder/react` into `@vocoder/core`
  - `VocoderTranslationData` now canonical in core; re-exported from config and plugin
  - Full unit test coverage across all packages (529 tests total)
  - Extractor internals split into shared/icu-builders, shared/roles, shared/transform, parse/react
  - New READMEs for core, config, extractor; updated react and root READMEs
  - Two-tier versioning: tooling packages fixed together, core and react version independently

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- docs(react): overhaul README for accuracy and completeness

  Corrects outdated component type (was Record<string, ReactElement>), wrong tag
  format examples (<link> → <0>), and wrong sortBy default. Adds full coverage
  of plurals, select, ordinals, format prop, function slots, object component form,
  React elements in values, extractor behavior table, and TypeScript exports.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: Lingui-style numeric component tags, function slots, expression safety

  **Tag format** (`<0>` replaces `<c0>`): Component placeholders in ICU strings now use Lingui-style numeric tags (`<0>`, `<1>`) instead of `<c0>`. The preprocessor normalises these to `<cN>` before ICU parse and restores afterward.

  **Function slots**: `components` prop now accepts render functions alongside React elements. `(children: ReactNode) => ReactNode` enables dynamic wrapper logic without a DOM element.

  **Object form**: `components` accepts `Record<number, ComponentSlot>` — sparse objects useful when skipping indices (`{ 0: <em />, 2: <strong /> }`).

  **React elements in values**: React elements passed via `values` are auto-promoted to self-closing component slots at render time — no manual `components` prop required.

  **Extractor expression safety**:
  - Numeric literals (`{42}`) inline as literal text instead of becoming positional placeholders
  - Boolean and null literals (`{true}`, `{null}`) are skipped — they render nothing
  - Conditional (`{a ? b : c}`) and logical (`{a && b}`) expressions trigger a bail with a warning — use `{cond ? <T>A</T> : <T>B</T>}` instead
  - Nested `<T>` inside `<T>` bails the outer element; the inner T extracts independently

## 0.13.4

## 0.13.3

### Patch Changes

- 8d3692e: Bold intro in sync command, highlight branch names and locale codes in sync log output.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- fix: validate vca* app key prefix instead of vcp*

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- ec4fa6b: Apply Vocoder brand colors to CLI TUI output. Pink (#D51977) for named values (file paths, locale codes, branch names), blue (#2450A9) for bars and structural elements in custom prompts, orange (#FC5206) for active cursor indicators.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: app-scoped API keys (vca\_) and CLI/MCP renames
  - Plugin requires vca* API keys; hard fail on non-vca* keys
  - CLI: getAppConfig, listApps, lookupAppByRepo, APIAppConfig, create-app command, --app-name flag
  - MCP: SyncBody updated with requestedMaxWaitMs/clientRunId/appIndustry, lookupAppByRepo

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix plan-limit reconnect to only offer projects already bound to the current repo. Removes locale/branch re-prompting when reconnecting.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- Remove `exclude` from generated `vocoder.config` — server-side defaults cover all common patterns.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- Store auth credentials in `~/.vocoder/auth.json` instead of `~/.config/vocoder/auth.json`.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add project management commands: `vocoder locales` (list/add/remove/supported), `vocoder project`, `vocoder translations`, and `vocoder create-project`. Plan limit errors now surface upgrade URLs across all CLI and MCP commands. New MCP tool: `vocoder_remove_locale`.

## 0.11.0

### Patch Changes

- feat(mcp): 3-tool init flow, workspace resolution fix, dotenv support
  - Split init into vocoder_init_start / vocoder_init_complete / vocoder_project_create matching CLI order
  - Workspace resolution moved to vocoder_project_create — prevents "already claimed" errors on re-runs
  - Stored auth token check in init_start skips browser flow when already authenticated
  - Install callback organizationId passed through to project_create, skipping workspace lookup
  - Added dotenv/config import so MCP process loads .env automatically
  - cli: removed apiUrl from AuthData (env var is source of truth); exported readAuthData/writeAuthData/clearAuthData from lib

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- **cli:** Cleaner sync output — branch spinner removed, batch ID is now `--verbose`-only, stats condensed into a single contextual line per outcome, wait timeout humanised to seconds.

  **plugin:** Sync-on-startup in dev mode. When the dev server starts and no translations exist yet for the current fingerprint, the plugin automatically calls the sync API, waits for completion with a live progress indicator, and loads the translations before the server is ready — so the first run feels fully translated without needing a push first.

  **cli/plugin/extractor/config:** `appIndustry` and `formality` from `vocoder.config.ts` are now propagated to the sync API on every push, keeping translation context current with the project configuration.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Word-based ordinal support (Arabic, Hebrew), gender-aware ordinal() API, CSS-only LocaleSelector theming, extractor ICU builder exports, ordinalForms replacing ordinalSuffixes, backwards-compat shims removed.

## 0.7.0

### Patch Changes

- Add suffix-free ordinal API and `ordinal()` function

  `<T value={rank} ordinal />` no longer requires `one`/`two`/`few`/`other` suffix props. The extractor generates canonical English ordinal ICU internally; the pipeline replaces branches with locale-correct patterns from the ordinalSuffixes DB.

  New `ordinal(value)` function available as `useVocoder().ordinal()` (reactive, inside components) and as a named export `import { ordinal } from '@vocoder/react'` (global, outside React).

  Breaking: `<T value={rank} ordinal one="#st" two="#nd" few="#rd" other="#th" />` — suffix props are ignored when `ordinal` is present. Use `<T value={rank} ordinal />`.
